-I would represent the marbles by a CLASS 
     -they would probobly be recognized by color or something color so say we have three colors (red, yellow, and  blue) they might also have multiple sizes (small medium or large.
     METHOD = marble constructing function(chosen by user or random)

-adding a marble to the marble bag consists of simply adding a FUNCTION that pushes the newest marble to another class(MARBLES) (also am I supposed to use python or C++?) I would set a limit for the class' capacity to 20 or so because a marble bag doesn't have an infanite capacity.
     VARIABLES= Array of marbles
              bag capacity
              marble count
     METHODS= add marble
              remove marble
              is empty
              is full
              
      




ALTERNITAVELY
-I could represent the marbles with a struct (same attributes as in the first) 
    I would have to make a
-marble bag would be an arrray that would get added to using a function. I could use a function to keep track of how many marbles have been added/removed to make sure it isn't over capacity
